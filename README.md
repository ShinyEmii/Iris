<h1>Iris</h1>
<h3>A C++ 2D game engine</h3>
<h4>About</h4>
Personal experiment.<br>
Made using OpenGL (GLFW, GLEW) and OpenAL.<br>
Shouldn't be used professionally.<br>
<h4>What it do</h4>
Currently it doesn't do a lot.<br>
You can load in textures, shaders, custom meshes (not fully finished) instead of default quad, create frame buffers.<br> 
It can also play audio.<br>
Custom made debugger allows you to log everything and time every scope if needed.<br><br>
Currently I'm working on creating objects in Scene namespace that make using core renderer and audio features easier to use.
